# CarRentalOOP
Project Description
This is a modular Car Rental System built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system includes user authentication (login), car and customer management, and rental transaction processing.
OOP Principles Applied
Encapsulation: Used private and public access modifiers to protect data within classes like Car and Customer.
Modularity: The system is broken into specialized files (Car.java, Customer.java, RentalAgency.java) rather than one single file.
Objects and Classes: Entities are represented as objects with specific behaviors and attributes.
File Structure
1. Main.java: The entry point. Handles the 3-try login logic and coordinates the system.
2. Car.java: Manages car data (ID, model, price, and availability).
3. Customer.java: Stores customer details.
4. RentalAgency.java: Contains business logic for calculating costs and processing rentals.
5. TestFiles.java: A test suite used to validate that all methods work correctly.
